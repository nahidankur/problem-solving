## Understanding the Problem

Before attempting to solve a problem, it's crucial to have a clear understanding of the requirements and constraints. This step involves carefully reading and analyzing the problem statement, identifying the inputs and expected outputs, and clarifying any ambiguities. Break down the problem into smaller parts if necessary.

## Devising a Plan

Once you understand the problem, the next step is to devise a plan or algorithm to solve it. Consider different approaches and strategies, and choose the one that seems most appropriate. Pseudocode can be helpful in outlining the steps of your solution before writing actual code. Some common problem-solving techniques include iteration, recursion, and using built-in JavaScript functions and data structures.

## Implementing the Solution

With a plan in hand, it's time to translate it into actual JavaScript code. Start by defining the necessary variables, functions, and data structures. Follow best practices for writing clean and readable code, such as using meaningful variable and function names, commenting when necessary, and following consistent formatting conventions. Break the problem down into smaller sub-problems and solve them one at a time.

## Testing

Testing is a crucial step in problem-solving to ensure that your solution produces the expected results. Write test cases that cover different scenarios and edge cases, considering both the normal inputs and potential error conditions. Use JavaScript testing frameworks or write your own test functions to automate the testing process. Debug any issues and refine your solution as needed.
